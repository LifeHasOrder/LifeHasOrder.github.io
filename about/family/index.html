          I was fortunate to find my best friend early in life. I even convinced her to marry me, and now I have someone with whom I can share all things.

          <p class="lead text-justify">Despite being an introvert, I find that life is much brighter when I can share my experiences with someone I love.  I have spent my life surrounded by an array of great people, and I am grateful for the contributions they made towards my development as a person and as a scientist. Thanks to my family & friends for providing love and support, to my educators for pushing me to always go further, and to my wife for accompanying me on this great journey.
