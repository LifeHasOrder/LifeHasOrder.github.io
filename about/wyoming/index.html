          Despite the rectangular dimensions, one cannot put Wyoming or its citizens into a box. Nonetheless, I think that many Wyomingites are united by their love of independence, and that is a trait that I can relate to.

          <p class="lead text-justify">I grew up as a country boy. One side of my family had a ranch, and the other side had a farm, both near Gillette, Wyoming. Thus, I was fortunate to have plenty of space to roam around, and I was given the freedom to explore the natural world from an early age. I also quickly developed a love for technology, with tractors being one of my earliest fascinations. Helping my grandfather harvest wheat each summer was the highlight of my year. We spent a lot of time together during this process, and he would teach me many things. For example, he taught me the importance of the weather, and how the nitrogen cycle is affected by lightning. So, I developed a passion for watching the turbulent summer skies.

          <p class="lead text-justify">Large cumulonimbus clouds such as this are a regular occurence on the High Plains of Eastern Wyoming during a summer afternoon. I prefer to call them "thunderheads." Each day the storms would develop to the west, then slowly roll in while darkening the sky. Usually these storms passed by quickly, but the wide open plains allowed one to watch the giant thunderheads as they moved east. These marvelous sights inspired me to learn about extreme weather, and were perhaps the beginning of my interest in science.

          <br>
          </br>
          <p class="lead text-justify">I also began to develop a passion for photography, and one of my first goals as an amature photographer was to capture an image of a lightning bolt. My love for photography quickly expanded though, I found that I had a strong set of preferences with regards to aesthetics, and I knew intuitively when I had captured the image I wanted.

          <p class="lead text-justify">Perspective is the key when you are searching for natural beauty. While I encourage you to visit Wyoming, I am certain that you can find beauty anywhere if you take the time to look for it.

          <p class="lead text-justify">As I grew older I began exploring the mountains with my dad, and I found that there are places in this world that words and images cannot fully capture. Some moments can only be experienced firsthand. The great thing about photography is that I can save a still of such a moment and then use it to cue my memory in the future. Always a bit of a daydreamer, I love how memories become idealized and stories grow out of them. My memories of the Wyoming wilderness provoke a deep sense of gratitude, awe, and peace.
