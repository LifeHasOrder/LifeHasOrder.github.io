    Despite the rectangular dimensions, one cannot put Wyoming or its citizens into a box. Nonetheless, I think that many Wyomingites are united by their love of independence, and that is a trait that I can relate to.

    <p class="lead text-justify">I grew up as a country boy. One side of my family had a ranch, and the other side had a farm, both near Gillette, Wyoming. Thus, I was fortunate to have plenty of space to roam around, and I was given the freedom to explore the natural world from an early age. I also quickly developed a love for technology, with tractors being one of my earliest fascinations. Helping my grandfather harvest wheat each summer was the highlight of my year. We spent a lot of time together during this process, and he would teach me many things. For example, he taught me the importance of the weather, and how the nitrogen cycle is affected by lightning. So, I developed a passion for watching the turbulent summer skies.

    <p class="lead text-justify">Large cumulonimbus clouds such as this are a regular occurence on the High Plains of Eastern Wyoming during a summer afternoon. I prefer to call them "thunderheads." Each day the storms would develop to the west, then slowly roll in while darkening the sky. Usually these storms passed by quickly, but the wide open plains allowed one to watch the giant thunderheads as they moved east. These marvelous sights inspired me to learn about extreme weather, and were perhaps the beginning of my interest in science.

    <img class="image" src="/img/lightning.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    </br>
    <p class="lead text-justify">I also began to develop a passion for photography, and one of my first goals as an amature photographer was to capture an image of a lightning bolt. I had always heard that one needs a really fast camera to take a good photo of lightning. At first glance this may sound sensible, after all lightning flashes very quickly, but this serves as a good example of the value of critical thinking. To capture an image using a camera, the detector needs to be exposed to light. If the detector "sees" a small amount of light then the image will be too dark, and if the detector "sees" too much light then the image will be overblown and will appear white. Thus, it is important to expose the detector to the proper amount of light to form a good image. Most cameras today are controlled by a computer and thus can fully automate the process. Nonetheless, there are still many cameras that allow one to control the exposure time, along with several other variables. If you have access to such a camera, as well as a good thunderstorm, I encourage you to try playing with these variables yourself. Do you think you should snap quick photos? Or should you leave the shutter open and wait for the lightning to come to you? My experience has shown that either approach will work, but the most important thing you will need is patience. You will have to take a lot of unilluminated photos to get a few good ones.

    <p class="lead text-justify">My love for photography quickly expanded beyond lightning, and I found that I had a strong set of preferences with regards to aesthetics. Check out the image above, what makes it unique? There are several choices I made that are in opposition to the rules for taking good photos. First, I am shooting directly into the sun. Second, the focal plane is much closer to the camera than most of the subject matter. This is enhanced by the low f-stop. Third, the camera is essentially sitting on the ground. All of these factors give the viewer an unusual perspective. I think this enhances the scene at hand, without obscurring the fact that a massive snowstorm has pushed these poor trees to their limits. In my opinion, the unusual perspective of the image makes the viewer stop and truly look at the scene. I could have taken an in-focus picture at eye-level with the sun at my back, in fact I did. I found those pictures a bit dull though, they looked more like documentation than art to me. That is completely subjective though, so there is no correct answer.

    <p class="lead text-justify">As I grew older I began exploring the mountains with my dad, and I found that there are places in this world that words and images cannot fully capture. Some moments can only be experienced firsthand. The great thing about photography is that I can save a still of such a moment and then use it to cue my memory in the future. Always a bit of a daydreamer, I love how memories become idealized and stories grow out of them. My memories of the Wyoming wilderness provoke a deep sense of gratitude, awe, and peace.
