Look<br>
what I found below the sidewalk. Is it<br>
a glimpse of the Twilight Zone?<br>
Someone<br>
ought to stoop over the entrance,<br>
and yell at them.<br>
They are doing it all wrong.<br>
Their world is upside down.<br>

For you and I<br>
can clearly see<br>
that their trees are growing down.<br>
Surely, an ominous sign<br>
<br>
I suppose, I could do the yelling.<br>
Yet I pause,<br>
unsure,<br>
realizing I have only glimpsed their world,<br>
and know nothing of it.<br>
How can I judge<br>
with such a narrow view?<br>
<br>
Is there<br>
another angle?<br>
<br>
Perhaps they<br>
are looking up,<br>
smiling<br>
and expressing gratitude<br>
for the shower<br>
that washed away our grime<br>
and opened a window between us.<br>
