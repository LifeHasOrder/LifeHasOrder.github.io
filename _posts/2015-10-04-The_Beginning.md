Welcome! WhyWolff is my personal website; the name is a creative play upon my last name, having a sense of curiosity, and the name of a popular mythical creature (ie: werewolves). My goal is to infect others with a sense of curiosity about the natural world, and to spread the joy that science and knowledge can provide. I feel that scientists are often portrayed negatively in the popular media, so I hope that by coming out of my shell I can do my small part to change that.

Most people start out as great scientists; as children we are capable of asking some of the most fundamental questions about the natural world, and we constantly do so. Over time many people lose this sense of wonder, or they even begin to fear science and mathematics.  It is true, they are difficult at times. Nonetheless, the key thing to remember is that science is about wonder and asking questions, not remembering facts from a textbook. While we certainly cannot all make our living as scientists, everyone can benefit from the power of scientific thinking. Even more importantly, citizens can participate in and influence scientific research. Furthering our knowedge about the natural world will improve your life, your family's lives, and our ability to make wise decisions. If you are on board with that last sentence, that is great. I bet you can list examples demonstrating this is true. If you are not on board with the idea that discovery promotes progress, that is OK, your skepticism will make you a great scientist!

More to come soon!
