title: "What is in a Name?"
subtitle: "Curiosity and Creativity"
summary: "I hope this website will serve not only as a creative outlet, but as a means to communicate science to you. In doing so, I will present myself as a whole person who has hobbies and delights in many things outside of the realm of science."

Welcome! This is where it all begins; I must say I am very excited to share my ideas with the world (that is if anyone decides to stop by)! I feel this is also the perfect opportunity to explain why I chose the name that I did. Firstly, I should mention that I have always been fascinated by the natural world around me, and I delight in the process of gaining knowledge. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that I am pursuing a career in science. The "why" in the website's name is an indication of this sense of wonder, which I hope to pass on to future potential scientists. As a first-year graduate student, I have little time to develop this site, but I appreciate your patience. There will be more content soon!
