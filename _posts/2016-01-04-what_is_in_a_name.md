Welcome! WhyWolff is my personal website, and I want to get this first post started by explaining the origin of the site’s name. Most individuals give their website an eponymous name of some sort, perhaps “firstnamelastname.com” if the domain name is available. Alas, my name is too common, so that option was already taken. That meant I had to get creative. My wife is much more creative than I am, so she helped me coin the phrase “WhyWolff.” I hoped to wrap my last name and the notion of being curious into this name. I also wanted the name to be reasonably similar to other words; something that people could remember and easily type into Google. Since “WhyWolff” so closely resembles the word “werewolf,” I think it may stick a little easier in people’s minds. Nonetheless, the name is not a under copyright protection, and I do not claim responsibility for anyone using or posting under such a name on the Internet. I use another phrase for social media accounts (i.e.: lifehasorder), and mine are all linked below.

With a name for the site, I then realized that I needed to have a direction or a short set of goals. This isn’t a rigid list, as I am sure the site will grow and change over time. I do want it to have a theme though, to avoid creating a dumping ground for ideas. The site’s name provides a clue of what I want to focus on in a general sense, which is being curious about the world around us. I see this as the driving force for science and discovery, and as a graduate student I spend most of my time thinking about science. Thus, it seems natural that science should be a central topic on the site. This prompts me to ask myself, “what do I want to say about science?” and in turn, “who is my target audience?”

The first question brings a myriad of answers to mind, but the second question brings one. I want this site to be accessible to the general public, and to young people especially. As a passionate scientist, I want to share my excitement with others. While most of my work on a daily basis is very technical, there are many skills that come from working in science that can benefit anyone. Plus, taking the time to translate technical topics into language that is more accessible may benefit the teacher even more than the student. I believe that if someone truly understands a topic, then they can explain it simply. I have found this to be true of my scientific heroes as well as the best mentors that I have personally known. There is no shame in starting off with a simple understanding and building from there.

In the spirit of simplicity, I will wrap up this first post. Although I do not yet have sharp goals for the site’s content, I do not want to over-constrain the content before I get much on here. The broad theme will be to focus on the promotion of scientific literacy and to encourage critical thinking. To motivate these goals I will share my enthusiasm for understanding the natural world, and for viewing each unresolved question as puzzle that we can break down into answerable bits. With each new answer we discover new questions we didn’t even know we should have asked, and the puzzle continues <i>ad infinitum</i>. I digress, which is a good sign that the future content will possess variety, and I hope you will stop by to check it out!
