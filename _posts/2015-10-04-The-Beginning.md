Welcome! This is where it all begins; I must say I am very excited to share my ideas with the world (that is if anyone decides to stop by)! I feel this is also the perfect opportunity to set the tone for the site, and to explain why I chose the name that I did. Firstly, I should explain that I have always been fascinated by the natural world around me and I delight in the process of gaining knowledge. Thus, it may not come as a surprise that I am pursuing a career in science. The "why" in the website's name is an indication of this sense of wonderment, which I hope to pass on to future potential scientists.
